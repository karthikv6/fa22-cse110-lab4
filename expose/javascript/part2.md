1. line 12 will print 3 as that is 1 more than how many times the loop ran.
2. line 13 will print 150 as that is the final value that was discounted (300*(1-0.5) = 150)
3. line 14 will print will print as 150 rounded up to the nearest whole number is 150
4. The function returns an array of the discounted prices. In this case it will be [50, 100, 150]
5. line 12 will print 3 as that is 1 more than how many times the loop ran.
6. line 13 causes an error as discountedPrice is declared using let, meaning that it is only accessible within the block it was declared in
7. line 14 will print will print as 150 rounded up to the nearest whole number is 150
8. The function returns an array of the discuonted prices. In this case it will be [50, 100, 150]
9. line 11 will print 3 as that is 1 more than how many times the loop ran.
10. line 12 will print 3 as that is the length of the input array prices
11. The function returns an array of the discuonted prices. In this case it will be [50, 100, 150]

#Arithmatic
1. 32 - concatenated strings 3 and 2
2. 1 - strings cannot be subracted, implies int
3. 3 - null = 0, 3 + 0 - 3
4. 3null - concatenated string 3 and null
5. 4 - true = 1, 1+4 = 4
6. 0 - false = 0, null = 0, 0 + 0 = 0
7. 3undefined - concatednated strings 3 and undefined
8. NaN - subrtraction implies int, cannot subrtract by an undefined value

#Comparison
1. true - values are compared directly and 2 is a greater value than 1
2. false - treated as string, compares largest first digit, 2 is greater than 1 
3. true - implies int comparison and 2 is equal to 2
4. false - includes type comparison and string 2 is not equal to int 2
5. false - true = 1 and not equal to 2
6. true - boolean of a single value will always return true and true is same data type and equal to true

.15. == compares implied values and === compares defined value 

.16. In JS file

.17. the array retruned by modifyArray will contain values that are equal to double the value of the array passed into the function. When callback is called in line 4, the fuinction - doSomething, that was passed in is called and returns the number passed in doubled. As, doSomething is called on every value in the input array, an array with the values doubled is returned.
