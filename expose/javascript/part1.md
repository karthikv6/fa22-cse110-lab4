1. line 9 prints "values added: 20", this is becuase add was true and num1 + num2 for the given inputs is equal to 20
2. Line 13 prints 20 as teh value of result was only modified one time when num1 was added with num2.
3. Line 9 prints "values added: 20", as num1+ num2 is equal to 20
4. line 13 will produces an error as result is declared with keyword let so it can only be accessed within the bloack it was defined in
5. the program will not reach line 9 as we are trying to modify a variable that had a constant decleration. If we were to ignore that, then line 9 will print "values added: 0"
6. line 13 will produce an error as const can only be accessed within the block it was deined in and line 13 is outside the blick result was defined in
